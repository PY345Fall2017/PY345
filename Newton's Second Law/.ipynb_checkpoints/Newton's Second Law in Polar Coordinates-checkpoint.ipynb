    "Next, let's examine the situation in which $m_2\\gg m_1$.  In that case, $\\ddot{y}\\approx \\frac{g\\cancel{m_2}}{\\cancel{m_2}}=-g$.  This means that Block 2 is basically in free fall if its mass is much bigger than that of Block 1, which makes sense.\n",

    "According to this expression, the bigger $\\mu_k$ becomes the smaller the acceleration becomes, which is reasonable.  If $\\mu_k$ is too big, however, then $\\ddot{y}$ turns into a positive number, which doesn't make any sense.  This means that our analysis assumes that the numbers are such that Block 1 would actually be sliding to begin with."
